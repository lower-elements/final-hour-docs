# Text Dialog

These virtual input boxes are designed to handle writing, editing, and submitting text. Each dialogue includes a title, which is announced upon its appearance.

## Key Bindings

-   Tab: Repeats the title.
-   F1: toggles word echo. When activated, the previously typed word is spoken back to you whenever you press the spacebar.
-   F2: Toggles character repeat. With character repeat enabled, each character you type is spoken back to you.
-   Enter: attempt to submit the contents of the text area. Use Shift+Enter to insert a new line.
-   Escape: Closes the text area gracefully.
-   Additionally, use the standard text editing controls: the up and down arrow keys for line-by-line navigation, and the left/right arrow keys for character-by-character navigation. Press Ctrl+Left/Right to navigate word by word, and use Shift in conjunction with these keys to select text.
