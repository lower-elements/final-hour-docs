# 2. Navigating the Map
If you've ever played many audio FPS games before, you might be used to the typical run with arrow keys, jump to dodge attack and the ability to track who ever you want from as far as you want. 
But Final Hour doesn't operate like that, we've taken (or at least tried to take) inspiration from how mainstream games tend to play. 

This chapter assumes you've not changed your key configuration yet, but working out what you've changed shouldn't be too hard. 

You should also have logged into the game where you should be able to hear some ambience, including water.



## 2.1. Let's take a little stroll should we?
WASD is the gaming standard for walking in 4 basic directions:

 - forward (the W key), 
 - left (the A key), 
 - backward (the S key) and 
 - right (the D key)

By default final Hour uses these keys, all though A and D are used for turning opposed to stepping left and right (strafing). For ease we've bound strafing left and right to Q and E respectively. 

If you haven't tried already, start turning and walking about, you'll probably hit a wall, a more intrusive sound to your normal foot steps.


## 2.2. Let's pick up the pace a little
You might have noticed that your walking doesn't seem very urgent and your turning is like a snail; so, you can use the shift key in combination with W and S to sprint forwards and backwards and the control key in combination with A and D to snap by 45 degree increments. 

You can't sprint while strafing as we felt this didn't make sense and made certain situations too easy to escape.

You can also use control+S to rotate by 180 degrees as well as control+W to reset all navigational directions to 0.


In order to climbe up and down ladders or staircases, you can use the page up and down keys. 
You can test these out at the east side of the main lobby map in the north and south corners. 


## 4.3. Extra details
In order to find your location, you can press your location key (C by default). This will list off a  lot of information, so consider visiting the location template chapter to configure it to your liking.

You can also press the V key to read out your zone which is a text description added by builders and is incredibly helpful in finding where you are.


We also have the player radar which tells you if players are within a 5 tile radius of you, press the radar key (Y by default) to see who's nearbye.


## 4.4. The Sonar
The sonar is toggeled with the f4 key. It alerts you to walls, gaps and air. The sounds take some getting used to,  so explore a little bit with it on.
