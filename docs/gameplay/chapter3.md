# 3. Weapons
There is actually a surprising amount to cover about weapons so lets dive in.

## 3.1. The Basics
There are 4 primary keys when it comes to your selected weapon:

 - Firing (the space bar),
 - Reloading (the R key),
 - Checking your loaded ammo (the Z key), and
 - Checking your ammo reserves (the X key)


You can switch weapons using the keys one through three. 
By default 1 is a knife, 2 is a revolver and 3 is a mp7. 


## 3.2. What about getting other weapons
You can purchase weapons as you progress through a match using the points you accumilate from killing zombies. 
Currently you can only purchase these from wallbuys, spots around the map where you can press the interact key (F by default) to activate them. If you don't have the weapon on the wallbuy, you'll replace your selected weapon with it. If you already have the weapon and its in your active slot, you'll spend points to reload the weapon.

Wallbuys are incredibly valueable and therefore can be extremely pricey so track your points throughout the match.


## 3.3. What if i want to take a vantage point?
There is always the situation late in a match where you're being overwelmed and you need to take cover on high ground. In this situation you can manipulate your pitch (your player's forward and backward tilt) so that you can shoot up or down. 

Use the J and K keys (by default) to move up and down respectively. You can add your snap modifyer (control by default) to move by 45 degree increments.

Remember shooting down or up can hit a wall if your'e not careful, don't waste ammo if you're not hitting things.

## 3.4. Explosives
Explosives, well, blow things up. Currently we only have frag grenades in the game but they are both a valueable and dangerous tool. 
Currently, the grenade is  the only item in the game that you can use that will kill yourself or other players, it can be accessed from the inventary (the i key).

when you select a grenade from your inventary menu, its pin will be pulled, you'll then have a short time to press interact (F by default)_ which throws it. 

Remember grenades can get get caught on players, zombies or walls so don't throw them in close quarters or at people, you'll end up killing yourself and your team mates.

Grenades will kill you if you're in their explosion radius, so run if one lands near you. They make a loud bleeping sound as they move through the air.
