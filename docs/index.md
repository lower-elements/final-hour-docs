# Welcome to the Final Hour Documentation
Welcome to Final Hour, an audio FPS inspired by Call of Duty Zombies. 

Final Hour is a complex, innovative audiogame that attempts to bring the experience of sighted and blind gamers closer together. Inspired by the Call of Duty Zombies franchise, we hope that the mainstream concepts will transport the blind gaming experience further from the limitting and unwieldy gameplay of current audiogames and closer to mainstreamâ€™s practicality.
This documentation will hope to help you in your first few games and teach you about the different game mechanics we have. 

If this is your first time visiting an audiogame this documentation will likely be esential as they can be overwelming and generally a bit cayotic if you don't know what all the different audio queues mean. If you've experienced audiogames before it will still be worth reading this documentation as final hour is very different to most audiogames in gameplay.
