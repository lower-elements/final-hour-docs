# introduction
These chapters will guide you through the process of building maps for both officially appointed builders and for general players. Even if you're not a official game builder, we recommend you use these tutorials to build a map and send it to a staff member, they'll check it out and then potentially use it and or make you a builder. Although in this case don't expect your map to be featured in the game.
